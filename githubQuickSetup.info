Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before

Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore. 


…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# basic-node-demo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/anilFS/basic-node-demo.git
git push -u origin main


…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/anilFS/basic-node-demo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
